## Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features

The best way to contribute is to report bugs or request new features. Please do this by **opening an issue** in the [Issues tab](../issues).

Please include:
* A clear title and description.
* Steps to reproduce (if it's a bug).

## Submitting Code (Pull Requests)

Since this is currently a conceptual prototype and student project, I am not actively seeking code contributions.

However, if you find a bug and want to fix it, I am happy to review it! Please follow the standard GitHub flow:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `feat/fix-that-bug`).
3.  Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
4.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** and link it to the Issue you created.

Thank you again for your interest!
